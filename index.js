//Create a variable called multiply set to an equation that will multiply the variables num1 and 
//num2; the result of the multiplication should be 62.
let num1=2;

//Create a variable called mod set to an equation that will calculate the 
//remainder of dividing variable num3 by num4; the remainder should be 4.

let mod = num3 % num4;

//Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a 
//set; the value returned should be 20.
